# AQI-Dashboard
1. Decoding Air Quality: An Analytical Study of AQI Trends <br>
A data-driven, analytical, and interactive dashboard built to evaluate AQI trends over time to compare the level of AQI and the distribution of pollutants(PM2.5, PM10, CO2, etc.), regionally, to guide priorities in future decision making and support environmental awareness. <br>
2. Air pollution is a global environmental problem that mostly influences the health of the urban and rural population. Over the past few decades, epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated adverse health effects associated with higher ambient levels of air pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 25% of all deaths in the developing world can be directly attributed to environmental factors (WHO, 2006). The problem of air pollution and its corresponding adverse health impacts have been aggravated due to increasing industrial and other developmental activities. To steadfast its commitment to reducing air pollution and providing a safe environment to the public, the government has launched ‘The National Air Quality Index’ (AQI) as ‘One Number- One Colour-One Description’ for the common man to judge the air quality within his vicinity. AQI informs the public about the current air quality and its health implications and stands as a measure to evaluate the level of pollution in different regions using a standardized method, which could be put to use in statistical analysis and research methods to develop region-specific models and strategies to mitigate the level of a particular pollutant or pollution level, as it gives real-time level of pollutants. As a beginner in data analytics, I built this project to explore how environmental data can be transformed into meaningful insights through systematic analysis. <br>
3. Tech Stack <br>
Power BI:
Power BI was used to design interactive dashboards and build a structured data model for visual analytics. <br>
DAX:
DAX formulas were implemented to create dynamic measures, KPIs, and time-intelligence calculations for deeper insights. <br>
4. Data Source - Kaggle <br>
5. Key Insights <br>
   📊 Interactive dashboard visualizing real-time and historical AQI trends <br>
   🌍 City-wise comparison of pollution levels and air quality categories <br>
   📈 Time-series analysis to identify seasonal and monthly pollution patterns <br>
   🚨 Identification of peak pollution periods and high-risk zones <br>
6. Business Impact <br>
   🌍 Enables policymakers to identify high-pollution zones for targeted intervention <br>
   📈 Improves transparency by making air quality data accessible and easy to interpret <br>
